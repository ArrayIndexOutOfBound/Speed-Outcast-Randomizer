Findings on this Randomizer : 
- Friendly and neutral NPC carry necessary items (for exemple, the key on kejim_base).
- Some NPC have to be locked, otherwise, we might get undefined behavior in cutscene or else.
- In ns_streets, no matter which npc (except the ones in the little arena) are forced on a path.
- IMPOSSIBLE to start a new game. The game just crashes, no 

TODO : 
- Lock all necessarry NPC per map (right now thinking about undercity and assembly, to open doors).
- Fixing G_FindConfigstringIndex (very hard).
- Stop the crashes (very hard).
- Maybe add some kind of items randomize ? Except the necessarry ones ofc.
